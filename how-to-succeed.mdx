## Mindset and Approach

### Take it Seriously
We acknowledge that our AI isn't perfect, but if you take the assessment seriously, it will help you showcase your skills effectively. Using AI allows us to give every candidate the opportunity to interview and share more than just what's on their resume.

### Be Clear and Concise
- **Articulate your answers clearly**: Speak in a clear, professional manner
- **Avoid long pauses**: Try not to take extended pauses during your responses, otherwise the AI may interrupt you
- **Stay focused**: Keep your responses relevant and on-topic

## During the Assessment

- **Think out loud**: Share your thought process as you work through scenarios
- **Ask clarifying questions**: If something isn't clear, don't hesitate to ask
- **Be authentic**: Let your genuine problem-solving approach shine through
- **Stay engaged**: Treat the AI interviewer as you would a human interviewer

## Remember

This is your opportunity to demonstrate your skills beyond what's written on your resume. The AI is designed to understand how you think and approach challenges, so focus on explaining your reasoning and methodology as you work through each scenario.
