---

We're not your typical assessment. Instead of generic questions, you'll work through real scenarios that mirror the challenges you'd actually face on the job. 

Our AI will ask follow-up questions to understand how you think through problems, handle objections, and navigate tricky situations. It's not just about what you'd do, it's about how you think and why you approach challenges the way you do. 

## Leveling the Playing Field

Prova is designed to help you as a candidate showcase your skills through job simulation. We're leveling the field when hundreds of applicants apply to the same job by giving everyone the same opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities beyond what's written on their resume.

## Real-World Scenarios

Rather than hypothetical questions, our assessments present you with realistic workplace situations. This allows you to:

- Demonstrate your problem-solving process
- Show how you handle complex situations
- Reveal your thought process and decision-making skills
- Showcase your professional communication style

## Interactive Assessment Experience

Our AI interviewer adapts to your responses, creating a dynamic conversation that explores not just what you would do, but why you would do it. This interactive approach provides a more comprehensive view of your professional capabilities.
