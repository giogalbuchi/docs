## How is my data stored and used after I take an assessment?

## Personal data Prova collects

Prova stores the following information about you after you take an assessment:

• **Video and audio data** of assessments taken, along with a transcript of the audio file.

• **Your assessment responses** and interactions in the AI roleplay.

• **Assessment metadata** including timing, completion status, and technical information.

• **Account details** if you create an account, including email address and basic profile information.

## Personal data that is shared with companies

When you complete a Prova assessment, the hiring company that requested the assessment receives:

• **Your assessment performance evaluation** based on your responses and interactions

• **Transcript and analysis** of your assessment session

• **Overall assessment score and ranking**

## How Prova uses AI

Prova uses AI in three primary ways:

1. **Conduct interactive assessments** with an AI that dynamically generates follow-up questions based on your responses and the specific job requirements
2. **Analyze your responses** to evaluate your problem-solving approach, communication skills, and professional competencies
3. **Generate assessment reports** for companies that include insights about your performance, strengths, and fit for the role


We may also use data from your assessment to measure how well our AI interviewer performed, troubleshoot technical issues, and make platform improvements.

## How to delete your data

You can request deletion of your assessment data by contacting our support team. You will receive a confirmation email once your data has been deleted for your records. 


## Practices Prova does not engage in

Prova does not:

• **Share your assessment data** with companies other than the one that requested your specific assessment

• **Sell your assessment data** to other companies or third parties

• **Use your assessments for unrelated purposes** beyond evaluation and platform improvement
